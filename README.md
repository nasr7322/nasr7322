# 💫 About Me:
Hi there! 👋 I'm Mohamed Nasr, a Computer and Systems Engineering student at Alexandria University with a passion for software engineering, problem-solving, and creative coding. I love building efficient solutions, exploring generative AI, and working on projects that blend technology with design.
